# Print & Play Guide

## Card Sheets
- Export `cards/card_list.csv` to your preferred layout tool (Nandeck, nanDECK, Component Studio, etc.).
- Suggested card size: 63 Ã— 88 mm (standard poker).
- Use light blue borders for Infrastructure, green for Workloads, red for Attacks, and yellow for Responses.

### Fast HTML Export
- Run `./tools/generate_card_sheets.py` to build ready-to-print HTML sheets at `cards/cards_print.html` (9 cards per sheet).
- Open the HTML file in a browser, set print scale to 100%, margins to none (or 0.5 in if required), and export to PDF.
- Use double-sided printing with the short edge as the flip if you add custom backs.

## Tokens and Markers
- Use coins, cubes, or cut-out circles for Resources (60 total needed).
- Resilience can be tracked with a single cube on the track printed on each Player Aid.
- Incident markers can be red cubes, glass beads, or card sleeves turned sideways.

## Player Aids
- Print `playmats/player_cluster_aid.md` on A4/Letter. Laminate for repeated dry erase use.

## Assembly Tips
- Shuffle Attack and Response cards thoroughly; they form a single deck together with all other cards.
- Sleeve prototype cards to mask paper thickness differences.
- Keep the Commons Row near the deck with space for a discard pile and an Incident marker supply.
