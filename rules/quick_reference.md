# Quick Reference

## Turn Phases
1. **Refresh** – Remove 1 Incident, draw to 5, gain 2 Resources.
2. **Plan** – Discard any cards for +1 Resource each (optional).
3. **Deploy** – Play or buy cards, pay costs, follow prerequisites.
4. **Incidents** – Resolve ongoing Incident text.
5. **Sabotage** – Play 1 Attack card (optional).
6. **Stabilize** – Repair, check SLO victory, eliminate if Resilience < 0.

## Build Requirements
- Need 1 Control Plane + 2 Nodes before any Workload.
- Keep Resilience > 0 to stay in the game.
- Hit 12 SLO (15 in duel) and survive the round to win.

## Common Costs
- Clear Node Incident: 1 Resource.
- Clear Control Plane Incident: 2 Resources.
- If a card has a custom repair cost, use that number instead.

## Table Etiquette
- Announce Attacks before resolving effects.
- Track SLO and Resilience with cubes on your board.
- Shuffle discarded Responses back into deck when empty.
